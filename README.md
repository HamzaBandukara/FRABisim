<h2>Requirements</h2>

The following is needed in order to run RABiT-j:
- java 17.0.2 2022-01-18 LTS

The following are needed in order to run RABiT (Older version):

- Python 3.9+
- SymPy (https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
- Antlr4 Version 4.3.9 (https://www.antlr.org/)

<h2>Usage</h2>
This section describes how to use the RABiT tool.

<h3>Tool Usage - Java</h3>

In order to run RABiT-j, enter one of the following into the command line from the project root directory:
- `java -jar ./rabitj/rabit.jar <TYPE> file1 file2 <TRIPLE>`
- `java -jar ./rabitj/rabit.jar -pi file1`

The first case is for running the tool on FRAs. file1 and file2 are paths to the two register automata in the XML format, and `<TYPE>` is the specific bisimulation type, with the following options:
- -b for on-the-fly standard
- -g for on-the-fly generator
The `<TRIPLE>` is the initial triple being tested for bisimulation, containing a state, a register mapping, and another state. 
For example, to test two stacks of size 5 (from state q1), 10 (from state q2) against each other using the on-the-fly generator algorithm (and an initial register mapping of 1 -> 2), you can run from the root directory:

`java -jar ./rabitj/rabit.jar -g jexamples/st/_5.xml jexamplesj/st/_10.xml "(q1,{(1,2)},q2)"`

The second case is for running the tool on pi-calculus processes. The two processes must be stored in one file. 
For example, to test a stack of size 5 against a stack of size 10, you can run from the root directory:

 `java -jar ./rabitj/rabit.jar -pi jexamples/pi/st5st10`

<h3>Tool Usage - Python(OLD)</h3>
In order to run the tool, enter the following from the command line from the project root directory:

`python rabit.py <TYPE> file1 file2 `

where file1, file2 are the paths to the two register automata / processes, and `<TYPE>` is the specific bisimulation type, with the following options:
  
- -f for on-the-fly standard
- -g for on-the-fly generator
- -e for on-the-fly exception
- -p for pi-calculus processes

For example, to test two stacks of size 5, 10 against each other using the on-the-fly generator algorithm, you can run from the root directory :
  
`python rabit.py -g examples/st/_5 examples/st/_10`

<h3>Fresh-Register Automata - Java</h3>

The structure of Fresh-Register Automata follows the one found <a href="https://github.com/sjrsay/deq">here</a>.
Each FRA is an XML file with a top level tag `<dra>` with children `<states>`, `<initial-state>` and `<transitions>`.
For this section, we will use a stack of size 2 as an example, which can be found in `/jexamples/ST/_2`

The states of the FRA are a list of `<state>` nodes, where each `<state>` has children `<id>` and `<available-registers>` (where `<available-registers>` is a list of `<register>` nodes).
For a stack of size 2, the states would look as such:

```
  <states>
    <state>
      <id>q0</id>
      <available-registers/>
    </state>
    <state>
      <id>q1</id>
      <available-registers>
        <register>1</register>
      </available-registers>
    </state>
    <state>
      <id>q2</id>
      <available-registers>
        <register>1</register>
        <register>2</register>
      </available-registers>
    </state>
  </states>
```

The initial state node for a FRA is simply the id of a state contained in `<states>`. 
For the stack of size 2 example, this would be:

```
  <initial-state>q0</initial-state>
```

The transitions for an FRA are a list of `<transition>` nodes, where each transition contains children `<from>` (the source), `<input>` (the tag), '<op>` (the operation or type), `<register>` (the register) and `<to>` (the target). 
For the stack of size 2 example, this would be:

```
<transitions>
    <transition>
      <from>q0</from>
      <input>push</input>
      <op>LFresh</op>
      <register>1</register>
      <to>q1</to>
    </transition>
    <transition>
      <from>q1</from>
      <input>pop</input>
      <op>Read</op>
      <register>1</register>
      <to>q0</to>
    </transition>
    <transition>
      <from>q1</from>
      <input>push</input>
      <op>LFresh</op>
      <register>2</register>
      <to>q2</to>
    </transition>
    <transition>
      <from>q2</from>
      <input>pop</input>
      <op>Read</op>
      <register>2</register>
      <to>q1</to>
    </transition>
  </transitions>
```

<h3>Fresh-Register Automata - Python</h3>
The structure for fresh-register automata are as follows:
  
```
{<States>}{<initial state>}{<available registers>}{<Transition relation>}{<final states>}
```

where:

- states is the set of states of the automaton, including an initial state and a set of final states
- available registers is a map assigning the registers available at each state; each map entry should be of the form (<state>, <registers>)
- transition relation is the transition relation, where each transition is of the form (src, tag, register, type, tgt), where:
  - src and tgt are the source and target states
  - tag is a label from a finite set of tags
  - register is a register index (an integer)
  - type is one of K (known), L ( locally-fresh) or G (globally-fresh)
- final states is the set of states the automaton can terminate at.
  
For example, creating a stack of size 2 would look like this:
  
```
{q0,q1,q2}{q0}{(q0)(q1,1)(q2,1,2)}{(q0,push,1,L,q1)(q1,pop,1,K,q0)(q1,push,2,L,q2)(q2,pop,2,K,q1)}{}
```

Where:
  
- q0, q1 and q2 are states
- q0 is the initial state
- q0 has no available register, q1 has only the register 1 available and q2 has the registers 1 and 2 available to it
- The transitions available to the automaton are as follows:
  - (q0,push,1,L,q1) is a transition from q0, with the tag 'push' on register 1 which is a locally-fresh transition
  - (q1,pop,1,K,q0) is a transition from q1, with the tag 'pop' on register 1 which is a known transition
  - (q1,push,2,L,q2) is a transition from q0, with the tag 'push' on register 1 which is a locally-fresh transition
  - (q2,pop,2,K,q1) is a transition from q1, with the tag 'pop' on register 1 which is a known transition
- And there are no final states

At each push operation, the stack reads in a name that is not currently in its registers (hence the L type). Thus, the stack will always contain distinct names.
  
<h3>Pi-Calculus Processes - Java</h3>
Pi-Calculus Processes have a grammar defined as such for processes:

```
root
    : (line NEWLINE)+ 'TEST' aprocess 'WITH' aprocess NEWLINE* EOF
    ;

line
    : aprocess
    | definition
    | NEWLINE
    ;

definition
    : PROCESSNAME '(' CHANNEL? (',' CHANNEL)* ')' '=' aprocess
    ;

aprocess
    : bprocess (SUM bprocess)*
    ;

bprocess
    : process (PAR process)*
    ;

process
    :  '(' aprocess ')'
    | CHANNEL ( '<' CHANNEL '>' | '(' CHANNEL ')') '.' process
    | '[' CHANNEL ('#' | '=') CHANNEL ']' process
    | '$' CHANNEL '.' process
    | '_t.' process
    | PROCESSNAME '(' CHANNEL? (',' CHANNEL)* ')'
    | '0'
    ;

processmid
    : (PAR | SUM) process
    |
    ;

CHANNEL     : [a-z] ([a-z] | [0-9])* ;
PROCESSNAME : [A-Z] ([A-Z] | [0-9])* ;
PAR         : '|'  ;
SUM         : '+'  ;

```
For example, a process could be:
`A(a) = a(b).A(b)`
for a process that receives some name on channel 'a', binds it to 'b' and then repeats using the name 'b'.

For process files, the file must first define any process definitions, and then it must state which two processes to test against each other. 
For example, the file could look as such to test `A(a)` against `D(a)`

```
A(b) = a(b).B(a)
B(a) = a<a>.A(a)
C(a) = $b.a<b>.D(a)
D(a) = $c.a<c>.C(c)
TEST A(a) WITH D(a)
```
  
<h3>Pi-Calculus Processes - Python</h3>
Pi-Calculus processes have a grammar defined as such for processes:
  
```
file    : (line '\n')*line EOF  ;
line    : process | definition ;
definition: PROCESSNAME '(' (CHAN ',')* CAHN ')' '=' process  ;
process :   '(' process ')' | process '|' process | process '+' process | zero | input | output | nu | eq | neq | proc;
zero    : '0'  ;
output   : CHAN '<' CHAN '>.' process ;
input  : CHAN '(' CHAN ').' process;
nu      : '$' CHAN '.' process ;
eq      : '[' CHAN '=' CHAN ']' process ;
neq     : '[' CHAN '#' CHAN ']' process ;
proc     : PROCNAME '(' (CHAN ',')* CHAN ')';
CHAN     : [a-z]+ ;
PROCNAME : ([A-Z] | [0-9])+ ;
```

For example, a process could be:
`A(a) = a(b).A(b)`
for a process that receives some name on channel 'a', binds it to 'b' and then repeats using the name 'b'.

With processes, the first line will be the process that is tested.
For example, if file 1 is:

```
A(b) = a(b).B(a)
B(a) = a<a>.A(a)
```
  
and file 2 is:
  
```
C(a) = $b.a<b>.D(a)
D(a) = $c.a<c>.C(c)
```
  
The tool will test whether C(a) and A(b) are bisimilar. 
  
RABiT can check bisimilarity for finite control processes (i.e. no parallel composition within recursive definitions) and assumes that processes follow a Barendregt convention on bound names (each bound name is distinct from free and other bound names).
